## PHP

### Folding

#### [rayburgemeestre/phpfolding.vim](https://github.com/rayburgemeestre/phpfolding.vim)

This plugin is pretty fast, but slows VIM down too much for my taste. In particular, there is a noticeable delay when switching buffers.

#### [swekaj/php-foldexpr.vim](https://github.com/swekaj/php-foldexpr.vim)

I love the way that this plugin folds PHP code, but it is even slower than phpfolding.vim.
