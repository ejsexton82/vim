# Rejected Plugins

The following vendor plugins have been rejected.

## PHP

### Folding

#### [rayburgemeestre/phpfolding.vim](https://github.com/rayburgemeestre/phpfolding.vim)

This plugin is pretty fast, but slows VIM down too much for my taste. In
particular, there is a noticeable delay when switching buffers.

#### [swekaj/php-foldexpr.vim](https://github.com/swekaj/php-foldexpr.vim)

I love the way that this plugin folds PHP code, but it is even slower than phpfolding.vim.

#### [artfulrobot/php-foldexpr.vim](https://github.com/artfulrobot/php-foldexpr.vim)

Claims to be a fast rewrite of swekaj/php-foldexpr.vim, but I couldn't see a difference.
